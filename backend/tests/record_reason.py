"""Write the scripted Meta reply for e2e's Spark Reason: `uv run python -m tests.record_reason`.
Free: no call reaches the Meta API.

e2e's reason spec queues Spark's Reasons and opens its Episode's Workstation. That Episode is
rejected for two failed grasp attempts before the grasp, so Spark's Reason is scripted here
(written_reason) to cite exactly those three times, the first failed attempt first. This replays
RECORDINGS to ingest the Episode, gives it a Reference label as e2e does, then runs the real
`reason` step once, keeping the reply RECORDINGS doesn't have. Rerun after changing the reason
prompt or schema, or what decides that Episode; e2e's Reason then stays the template one.
