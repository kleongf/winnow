"""Re-record the Meta responses that tests and e2e replay: `uv run python -m tests.record_meta`.

Runs the real ingest pipeline (Spark-alone baseline and wrist track) against the Meta API on the
e2e fixture Episodes, compiles the frozen Description against e2e's Dev set and recompiles it
with one Phrase edited (EDITED), then boxes each Episode with E2E_BOX in each exterior view in
turn and runs what a saved box queues (exterior track and target box), writing every reply to
RECORDINGS. Costs about $0.80, which is added to the main cost log. Re-record after changing a
prompt, a schema or the fixture Episodes.

With `--missing`, replies already recorded are replayed and only the calls missing from
RECORDINGS (a changed compile prompt, a new edit, a new fixture Episode) are made for real, their
clips uploaded, and appended; only their cost is logged. Cents, not dollars.
