"""Where a visual Criterion's clip comes from: one view, the Criterion's window padded a little,
and for placement the object's final box joined with the target box, enlarged.

The window comes from measured events (the grasp and the release, `criteria.windows`); tracked
events can narrow it here once they exist. Clips are named by a hash of what they show, so
cutting the same clip again finds it already there and its Meta calls stay cache hits.
