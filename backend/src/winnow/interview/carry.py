"""Which interview answers still hold after a recompile, which edits only part of the Description.

An answer about a Phrase, or words in no Phrase, that the edit left alone still holds, moved to
where its text now sits; so does every answer on a threshold, or on whether a Criterion is hard,
of a Criterion whose Phrase was kept, so a bisection goes on where it was. Answers on the grasp
settings, which an edit never changes, always hold. Answers about text the edit changed or took
out drop out of the interview: their questions are asked again, of the new text. Pure: the
caller saves what it returns.
