"""The curator's own words in the interview, read by Spark: the only interview answers that ask a
model.

To the question being asked, one cheap call maps the words onto one of its answers, which then
applies exactly as if picked (`service.answer`); or, on a Phrase, words or threshold question,
onto "change", and only then does a second call compile the asked text again with the words
(`rubric.service.clarify_draft`). Two calls, not one, because most words just pick an answer:
that call is small and low effort, while a compile call carries the whole capabilities manifest
and reasons at length. With no question, one call edits the Description with the words, which
then recompiles as any edit does.
