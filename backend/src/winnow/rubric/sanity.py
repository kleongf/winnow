"""The Rubric sanity monitor: a warning about the Rubric, never about one Episode.

For each hard Criterion it reads the anchor pool's fail rate (with its Wilson interval), warns
when the rate is below 2% (the Criterion rejects almost nothing) or above 95% (almost everything),
and lists the Episodes only that Criterion rejects, so the curator sees what it removes. It reads
the same Dev set, labels and margin multiplier s as the preview it extends.
