"""Calibrating the latest Rubric version on the anchor pool's labels, and accepting a threshold
they suggest.

Only anchor-pool Episodes with a Reference label take part (the Dev set, never the Test set),
with only their interview and review labels: audit labels measure Keep precision alone. Each is
scored with no label applied, so the labels judge Winnow's own results. Everything is the pure
scoring function over stored facts, so calibrating makes no model call.
