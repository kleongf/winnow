"""The `track_wrist` step: SAM tracks the held object in the wrist view, with no human input.

The wrist camera is fixed relative to the gripper, so just after the first closure the object
sits at the same spot in every Episode. SAM is seeded there with a point, plus negative points
on the fingers so it doesn't segment the gripper, and tracks both ways from that frame.
Settled on droid_100 Episodes 16 and 42 and droid_1.0.1 Episodes 1, 9 and 17 (#17).
