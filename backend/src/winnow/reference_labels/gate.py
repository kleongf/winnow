"""The blind gate. Until an Episode has a first-pass Reference label (a relabel doesn't count),
its Winnow and Spark-alone outputs (Triage decision, Reason, Criterion and Phrase results,
confidence, baseline answers) and its Dataset outcome stay out of every response the app reads,
so labels are given blind.

Every route serving a per-Episode output goes through here: one Episode's output takes a
`RevealedEpisode` (403 until labelled), a list of outputs reads only `revealed_episodes(ctx)`.
Episode facts (video, robot data, object tracks) aren't outputs and stay visible."""
