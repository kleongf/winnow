"""How sure each result is: a Criterion's status, Uncertainty signal and p_pass, then a Phrase's
p, P_keep and the Episode's confidence.

p = 1/(1 + e^(-3m)), with m the signed distance from the threshold in effective margins
(effective margin = max(noise floor, interview gap) * S). A measurement within one effective
margin of its threshold is unsure ("near threshold"); an inconclusive primitive never pulls p
below 0.5; no value gives 0.5; a human label gives 1 or 0.
