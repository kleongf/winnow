 * inside the release height's margin, less confidently when i % 6 == 4 ("Move the black remote
 * control to the left"); 2 is rejected after two failed grasp attempts, with no instruction and a
 * failing Dataset outcome. Unboxed, every Episode that isn't rejected needs review: placement has
 * no exterior track. Boxed in Exterior 2 with PLACED_TARGET drawn (`boxForPlacement`), Episodes
 * 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 12, 15, 16 and 18 have a healthy recorded track, so i % 3 == 0 is kept; the
 * rest have none to speak of (17's is unchecked), so their placement is unsure with "track
